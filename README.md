# VoxelEngine
VoxelEngine for learning purposes written in C++ using OpenGL. Inspired by https://github.com/JamesRandall/SimpleVoxelEngine and a lot of the OpenGL boilerplate comes from https://learnopengl.com/. Initial goal is to create a Minecraft clone with comparable features (Procedural worlds, lighting, physics). This will be structured as a voxel library that intends to be agnostic and resuable as well as clone-specific code which will utilise the voxel library. OpenGL and 3D Graphics in general are new to me so this project won't have a linear path and will probably involve lots of rewrites as I develop my understanding

## Running the project
1. Open in VS 2022
2. Set the 'minecraftClone' project as the start up project (inside the examples folder)
3. Run the project
